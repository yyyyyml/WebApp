6. Summary:
- (1): This paper focuses on continuous learning for video analytics, where a lightweight expert DNN model is adapted for each video scene to cope with real-time data drift.
- (2): Existing adaptation approaches suffer from delay and compute costs due to periodic retraining. Selecting historical models can lead to accuracy loss. The approach in this paper integrates model reusing and online model retraining to address these problems.
- (3): The proposed RECL framework shares a "model zoo" of expert models across edge devices, allowing history model reuse. It uses a fast procedure to select an accurate model and dynamically optimizes GPU allocation for model retraining, model selection, and model zoo updates.
- (4): The evaluation of RECL on real-world videos shows substantial performance gains in object detection and classification tasks compared to prior work, with further improvement over the system lifetime. The performance achieved supports the goals of the research. (在真实世界的视频中，对物体检测和分类任务进行的RECL评估显示，与先前的工作相比，取得了显著的性能增益，并在系统的寿命中进一步改善。已实现的性能支持研究目标)





8. Conclusion:

- (1): The significance of this piece of work lies in addressing the challenge of resource efficiency in video analytics applications by proposing a responsive and resource-efficient continuous learning framework, RECL. This framework integrates model reusing and online model retraining to optimize computation and mitigate data drift, leading to improved accuracy and reduced overhead in real-time video analysis.

- (2): Innovation point: RECL introduces the concept of a "model zoo" for sharing historical expert models across edge devices, enabling efficient reuse and adaptation. This enhances resource efficiency and response time in continuous retraining.

Performance: The evaluation of RECL on real-world videos demonstrates substantial performance gains in object detection and classification tasks compared to prior work. It achieves higher accuracy and improves performance over the system lifetime.

Workload: RECL efficiently handles the workload by employing a fast model selection procedure, GPU allocation optimization, and an iterative training scheduler. This reduces compute costs, mitigates delay, and achieves better resource efficiency.

Overall, the innovation in integrating model reusing with model retraining, the improved performance in video analytics tasks, and the optimized workload management of RECL make it a valuable contribution to the field of continuous learning for video analytics.
